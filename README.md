This package began as a fork of the [official](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) but incomplete Swift SDK for MCP. It implements all features from MCP protocol version 2025-11-25.

## Update Policy

This package follows semantic versioning. Breaking changes are only introduced in major versions. After a new major release, the previous major version will receive bug fixes and security updates for at least 3 months.

Package dependencies are kept up to date as needed for compatibility and security.

## Roadmap

This package fully implements MCP protocol version 2025-11-25 and passes all required [conformance tests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/conformance). Future spec versions will be implemented as they are released.
